									<p>A little league game can lack action with five pitches and no outs. So if you're child gets bored in the field that's completely normal. Encouraging them to play their best and to have fun is the most important thing you could do. </p>

								<div class="content span-7">
									<h2 class="major">Fielding</h2>
									<p>Keeping an athletic position in the field makes getting to a ball easier. In the infield your ready position should look like the one in the photo. Gloves should be on the ground with cover hand ready. This is important because when your child grows older balls come to them harder. Pop flies should be caught with two hands with the glove net up and above the child's head not with the net towards the ground.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Base Running</h2>
									<p>Base running isn't really a big deal in little leagues, but the sooner they develop habits like pumping their arms while running and taking long strides is great. Rounding the bases comes later.</p>

								<div class="intro color2">
									<h2 class="major">Throwing & Catching</h2>
									<p>You can help your children by playing catch with them. Don't let them sidearm the ball and keep your throws slow and easy for your kid to catch. Show them that when the ball is below their waist their glove net is down; by their head, the glove net is up</p>

									<h2 class="major">Hitting</h2>
									<p>Practicing swinging on the tee is a great way to get your child accustomed to the form of their swing. You can tell them these tips to make it easier for them.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Keep your knees bent, just a little.</li>
										<li>Dominant hand above the nondominant hand on the bat</li>
										<li>Line your knocking knuckles up</li>
										<li>Keep your bat up away from your head</li>
										<li>Eyes always on the ball</li>
